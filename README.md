### 3. Install and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BuildWithDuke/allo.git
cd allo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set bot token
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN='your_token_here'

# Run the bot
python intro_bot.py
```

## Configuration

Edit these variables at the top of `intro_bot.py`:

### Basic Settings
```python
INTRO_CHANNEL_ID = 0              # Channel ID for introductions (use !setintrochannel)
GRACE_PERIOD_HOURS = 72           # Hours before kick (default: 72)
CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES = 60       # How often to check (default: 60)
REMINDER_TIMES = [24, 48]         # When to send reminders in hours
```

### Advanced Settings
```python
EXEMPT_ROLE_IDS = []              # Role IDs exempt from intro requirement
WELCOME_ROLE_ID = 0               # Role to assign after intro (0 = disabled)
MOD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID = 0            # Channel for mod logs (0 = disabled)
BOOSTER_GRACE_HOURS = 0           # Extra hours for boosters (0 = disabled)
```

### Validation Settings
```python
MIN_INTRO_LENGTH = 0              # Minimum intro characters (0 = disabled)
REQUIRE_KEYWORDS = []             # Required words in intro (empty = disabled)
```

### Example Configurations

**Strict Server** (200+ char intro, 48h deadline):
```python
GRACE_PERIOD_HOURS = 48
REMINDER_TIMES = [12, 24, 36]
MIN_INTRO_LENGTH = 200
REQUIRE_KEYWORDS = ["name", "age", "location"]
```

**Relaxed Server** (no validation, 1 week deadline):
```python
GRACE_PERIOD_HOURS = 168
REMINDER_TIMES = [72, 120]
BOOSTER_GRACE_HOURS = 72  # Boosters get 10 days total
```

**Gaming Community** (role rewards):
```python
WELCOME_ROLE_ID = 123456789  # "Member" role
EXEMPT_ROLE_IDS = [111111111, 222222222]  # Staff and VIP roles
MOD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID = 987654321  # #mod-logs channel
```

## Commands

All commands require Administrator permissions.

### Configuration Commands
- `!setintrochannel #channel` - Set the introductions channel

### Management Commands
- `!checkpending` - View members pending introduction (with time remaining)
- `!scanexisting` - Find existing members without intros
- `!trackexisting <hours>` - Start tracking existing members with custom grace period

### Override Commands
- `!markintroduced @user` - Manually mark user as introduced (assigns role, removes from tracking)
- `!untrack @user` - Stop tracking user without kicking them
- `!resetcache` - Rebuild cache of introduced members from channel history

### Information Commands
- `!stats` - View bot statistics and configuration

## How It Works

### New Member Flow
1. **Member Joins** ‚Üí Bot checks if they have an exempt role
2. **Added to Tracking** ‚Üí DM sent with welcome message and deadline
3. **Reminders Sent** ‚Üí At configured intervals (e.g., 24h, 48h)
4. **Grace Period Expires** ‚Üí Member kicked if no intro posted
5. **Or Posts Intro** ‚Üí Removed from tracking, role assigned (if configured)

### Intro Validation
When a member posts in the intro channel:
1. Check minimum length (if enabled)
2. Check required keywords (if enabled)
3. If validation fails ‚Üí Message deleted, DM sent with requirements
4. If validation passes ‚Üí ‚úÖ reaction added, role assigned, tracking stopped

### Mod Logging
All actions are logged to the mod channel (if configured):
- üëã Member join (with grace period)
- ‚è∞ Reminders sent (with time remaining)
- ‚úÖ Successful introductions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Kick warnings (before kick)
- ‚ùå Members kicked
- Manual admin actions

## Required Bot Permissions

- **Kick Members** - To remove non-introduced members
- **Manage Roles** - To assign welcome role
- **Send Messages** - To send DMs and channel messages
- **Read Message History** - To scan intro channel
- **Add Reactions** - To react to introductions
- **View Channels** - To access configured channels

## Files Generated

- `pending_members.json` - Members currently being tracked
- `introduced_members.json` - Cache of all introduced members
- `.gitignore` - Prevents committing sensitive data

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Set a Mod Log Channel**: Use `MOD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID` to track all bot actions
2. **Test First**: Use `!trackexisting 1` on yourself to test the bot
3. **Exempt Staff**: Add staff role IDs to `EXEMPT_ROLE_IDS`
4. **Reward Boosters**: Set `BOOSTER_GRACE_HOURS` to give them extra time
5. **Use Role Gates**: Assign a "Member" role that unlocks channels
6. **Monitor Pending**: Regularly check `!checkpending` to see who needs reminders

## Troubleshooting

**Bot not tracking members?**
- Ensure `INTRO_CHANNEL_ID` is set correctly
- Check bot has required permissions
- Verify "Server Members Intent" is enabled

**Members not getting kicked?**
- Check bot has "Kick Members" permission
- Bot's role must be higher than target member's highest role
- Check console for error messages

**Roles not being assigned?**
- Verify `WELCOME_ROLE_ID` is correct
- Bot needs "Manage Roles" permission
- Bot's role must be higher than the role it's assigning

**Cache seems wrong?**
- Use `!resetcache` to rebuild from scratch
- Check intro channel permissions (bot needs read history)
